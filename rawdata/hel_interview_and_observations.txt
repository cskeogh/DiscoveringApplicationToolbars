Application A
average hours using computer at work/study per day: 8hrs
average hours using computer at home: 1hrs
years on computers: 25

observations:
tried menu first
tried to drag
double click to place item
"I noticed there was no add in element menu, used to using the menu"

questions:
1: strongly B
2: strongly B
3: marginal B
4: Application B popup appeared straight away. Didn't have to wait.
5: no
6: Application B is better than application A because of quick popups.
Suggest green plus signs on the icons if an add operation, red negative if
a delete operation.
Expect an 'Add Element' in the menu, and plus the icon in the menu that matches
the toolbar icon.
I like the help up the top, but I can see it can be a hinderance to exper users.
I noticed the help text hides the menu, but I'm used to that because the latest
Microsoft Word does similar.
7: Used a bad example where there is a popup menu that follows the mouse.
I wished Word would be handly like application A.
I used a program where help was in the status bar.

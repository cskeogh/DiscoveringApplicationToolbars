Application A
average hours using computer at work/study per day: 8hrs
average hours using computer at home: 2hrs
years on computers: 25

observations:

questions:
1: Marginal B
2: Strongly B (although this may because I already did A and knew where the tabs were)
3: Strongly B (but again, perhaps bias from having done A first)
4: The tab names popped up easier in B than A and were faster to appear,
whereas in A you have to mouse in the lower right to get the explanation of what the tab
is in B anyhwere on the tile pulls up the info
5: slightly annoying that the boundaries, elements etc that you create are all of a
predetermined size rather than able to be created freehand with mouse, but that's
probably not the purpose of the task. Likewise I couldn't get any of the other menu
options to do anything
6: the text in the toolbar info could be centered over the tile it is describing instead
of all being on the far left, and perhaps the text box could be closer to the size of the
text instead of covering the whole length of the menu area (more like how the drop down
list appears with all the other headings, but with the ease of program B instead of having
to find a corner in A
7: none come to mind, but i don't pay a lot of attention to toolbars most times

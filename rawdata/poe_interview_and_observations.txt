4: Application A, because of the long delay suggested the was no tooltip. Application B is
more responsive. Allows searching for desired function a lot quicker.
5. Application B: Annoying that is hides menu. hiding the menu limits an experienced user who knows
the menu well - it will slow decision making. The tooltip should have its own location.
Tooltip has poor placement.

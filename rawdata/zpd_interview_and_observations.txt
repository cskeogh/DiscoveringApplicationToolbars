observations:

questions:
1: strongly A
2: marginal B
3: marginal A
4: 3 second tooltip delay compared to no delay
5: application B: tooltip appears in an area I didn't expect. Covers the main menu.
Application A is more standard. One toolbar button is slightly bigger.
6: Drop the delay by 50%. No more than 2 seconds (between 1-2 seconds).
Instant tooltips is an option, a small delay is better.
7: display text as well as the icon. Have icons that are more meaningful representation
 of the function. Add a small plus to corner of icon that provides extra information.

4: faster to display help. takes a while to hover.
5: normally select items to align
can't see the file menu. I like to see everything.
6. include the same icon in the tooltip help.
In Application B, there is a problem when you are near the boundary, you don't know what
button the mouse is on, and subsequently don't know which the help is for.
7. I don't use help, I get familar with the icon pictures.
- I like to customise, and group icons to my preference and my workflow, and separate with
 a space.
- text under the icons.

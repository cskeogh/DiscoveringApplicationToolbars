Application B
average hours using computer at work/study per day: 8hrs
average hours using computer at home: 2hrs
years on computers: 25

observations:


1: Strongly A
2: Strongly B
3: Strongly B
4: It was faster to learn B due to the tooltips displaying quicker than in A. Meaning I could hover on each
5: B may have been easier and faster to learn however it was the most annoying. The tooltips take up too much
   real estate and cover the menu when they appear. With no delay on displaying the tooltips it becomes annoying
   once one is more familiar with the toolbar and the application. The tooltips are always flashing up even when
   the mouse passes over a button as you are going to the menu, for example.
6: B. Tool bar help could be improved by having additional information along with the basic help (if applicable).
   For example: Add note – Insert note to diagram by double clicking mouse inside workspace. Shortcut key
   combinations could also be included, if applicable. Something else to consider is the toolbar doesn’t always
   have to be at the top. Depending of the application it may be more beneficial to have the toolbar vertical on
   the side of the application. In this instance you may not require a delay displaying the tooltip.
7: A good example that seems to be the norm is in MS Paint (Windows 7 and above).
